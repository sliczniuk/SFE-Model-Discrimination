This study investigates the process of chamomile oil extraction from flowers. A parameter-distributed model consisting of a set of partial differential equations is used to describe the governing mass transfer phenomena in a solid-fluid environment under supercritical conditions using carbon dioxide as a solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. Based on the set of laboratory experiments performed under multiple constant operating conditions: $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s, two process models are developed. The goal of this work is to design an experiment to discriminate between two competing process models. Statistical methods, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann–Whitney U test, and Jensen–Shannon divergence, are used to discriminate between two models under the parameter uncertainty.
