This study investigates the process of chamomile oil extraction from flowers. A parameter-distributed model consisting of a set of partial differential equations is used to describe the governing mass transfer phenomena in a solid-fluid environment under supercritical conditions using carbon dioxide as a solvent. The concept of quasi-one-dimensional flow is applied to reduce the number of spatial dimensions. The flow is assumed to be uniform across any cross-section, although the area available for the fluid phase can vary along the extractor. The physical properties of the solvent are estimated from the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The empirical correlations used in the model are based on the set of laboratory experiments performed under multiple constant operating conditions: $30 - 40^\circ C$, $100 - 200$ bar, and $3.33-6.67 \cdot 10^{-5}$ kg/s. The model-based design of the experiments technique is applied in this work to design an experiment to discriminate between two competing process models. %The mass flow rate and the inlet temperature are used as decision variables to minimizing the volume of the confidence
%ellipsoid. As a result, the optimal control problem is numerically solved to obtain the controls, which maximises the Fisher information contained in the yield curve.
